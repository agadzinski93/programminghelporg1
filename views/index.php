			<p class="programmingText">No source can teach you everything. In fact, with changes being made to the computer world everyday, it is impossible. Remember, the best way to learn is to create software on your own. Start small and share what you have created with people in online communities and ask for feedback. Check out open source projects to see if you can read other people's coding styles. Lastly, order textbooks covering topics that interest you. A strategy is to search online stores and read reviews left by other users to determine if a book in question is well received.</p>
